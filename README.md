**TeamBuilder for Overwatch**

A simple tool for building and analyzing team compositions in Overwatch.
Built entirely in Java.


**Instructions**

Hero names can be manually typed into their text fields, or randomly 
generated with the AutoGen button. If manually entering Hero names,
strip names of any punctuation:


D.Va -> DVa


Soldier: 76 -> Soldier 76


Fields are not case-sensitive. Duplicate names are not permitted.


Once the fields have been populated, press the Analysis button to evaluate
the composition, or press the Reset button to clear the fields. 


**TODO:**

* Adjust FXML such that app can be maximized or resized
* Improve readability of analysis font
* Implement optional dark theme
